# appimage-installer
A simple program to integrate AppImages into the GNU/Linux system.

I am learning Python and GNU/Linux so I probably don't know what I am doing :). Use at your own risk!
I intend to learn how to package this properly, I will get around to it when I can.
Any tips and constructive criticism is welcome.
